1) string and character array
2) cin dont take white space (delemeter -> \n, space, \t)
3) character arrays vs string ? 
ANS: 
-> C++ strings can contain embedded \0 characters, know their length without counting. But in case of 
char [] or char* will take a pointer to a single char as a parameter and will track along the memory until a 0 memory 
value is reached (often called the null terminator).

->strings are faster than heap-allocated char arrays for short texts 
and protect you from buffer overruns. 

-> Strings also have more builtin function.

-><- Problem with getline() after cin :-
use cin >> ws to extract all white spaces
So special care should be taken care of about using getline() after cin because cin ignores white space characters and leaves it in the stream as garbage.
